# modules

This directory serves to explain higher-level design decisions made in tmedia's
structure that don't encapsulate a single file or section of the source code,
such as the flow of data through a module.

If a file here does not contain documentation explaining it in a high level,
chances are the include files and source files in the source code itself would
have the documentation instead. Some little one-off notes may also be left
in this file from time to time if I feel it should be given a stronger
explanation.
