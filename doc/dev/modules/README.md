# modules

In general, a module is a directory in include/ or src/ that contains code
that's fine-tuned for a specific use case.

This directory serves to explain higher-level design decisions made in tmedia's
structure that don't encapsulate a single file, module, or section of the
source code.

If a module here does not contain documentation explaining it in a high level,
chances are the include files and source files in the source code itself would
have the documentation instead. Some notes may also be left
in this file from time to time if I feel it should be given a stronger
explanation.
