# tmedia/doc

For more developer-facing documentation, such as design goals, software
structure, and building specifics, the [doc/dev](./dev/README.md) directory
contains much of such relevant information.

The structure of this directory isn't really concrete, if something is both
developer facing and user facing, it should be in same directory level as this 
document and block out developer documentation with "\>" blocks.
